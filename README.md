# AI Clone

Welcome to the AI Clone project, where I've recreated an AI version of myself using my LinkedIn chat history as a foundation.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've employed cutting-edge technologies to bring this AI clone to life. The backend is powered by LLAMA2, seamlessly integrated and accessed through AWS Bedrock infrastructure. On the frontend, I've crafted a interface using Streamlit.
