771,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,Any time
772,Iris John,Praneeth Korukonda,Thank you ! This was so helpful .
773,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,So with ta/ra you’ll only get monthly stipend 
774,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,You can get ta/ra roles but northeastern wont waive any tuition 
775,Iris John,Praneeth Korukonda,can we get into TA / RA roles to support funds? Do we get tution waivers in that case ?   And thank you so much for sharing!!
776,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,"And co-ops it completely depends on you, like there will be jobs available but it depends on your consistency and luck to get through these"
777,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,Like you can’t club 2 semesters for ex: spring+fall but you can club spring+summer
778,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,Semester 
779,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,You can only do co-op for 1 semester or semester + summer semmai 
780,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,"Nope, mostly there will be no scholarships for international students "
781,Iris John,Praneeth Korukonda,Few questions from my side : 1.Is it possible to get scholarships for tuition fee waiver ? 2.Can we do Co-op program both years?( 2 semesters ) 3. How difficult is it to get through these ?
782,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,"Compared to the data science program, the data analytics program is industry focused, the data science program is highly math focused"
783,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,"The program is good, but I don’t know much about silicon valley campus"
784,Praneeth Korukonda,Iris John,Hi
785,Iris John,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hi Praneeth ! Iris this side . I had applied for data science programs at NEU. Although I wanted data science masters , now I have received admit for  analytics program at Silicon Valley campus . I came accross your profile and since you are also doing MS is Analytics I wanted to know more about this program from you . How is the overall structure of the program and how good is the program compared to data science masters etc.This would help a lot at this point . Thank you !"

790,Robert Becotte,Praneeth Korukonda,"Fantastic news, Praneeth!! You’ll be in great hands under Casey and Rajen! Please send me a ping on Teams when you join"
791,Praneeth Korukonda,Robert Becotte,"Hello Rob, I trust you're well. I'm excited to share that I've received an offer from Fidelity. I'll be joining Rajen's team and will start working under Casey this upcoming spring.  Best, Praneeth "
792,Praneeth Korukonda,Robert Becotte,Thanks 
793,Robert Becotte,Praneeth Korukonda,"Very glad to hear that, best of luck and hope to see you on the team!"
794,Praneeth Korukonda,Robert Becotte,"Thanks for your kind feedback rob, I'll definitely work on improving my articulation and being more accurate in my self-assessment. It's a great reminder that a strong foundation and correct basics are crucial in any technical field, and I'll keep that in mind for my future endeavors.  I had a successful interview with Rajen's team, Casey and David today, and if everything goes well, I hope to join Fidelity.  Thanks, Praneeth"
795,Robert Becotte,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hi Praneeth - Thanks for reaching back out, very glad to stay connected with you.   Acknowledging up front that interviews are inherently tricky/stressful and it’s challenging to always best showcase your skills on the spot.   That said, I thought you interviewed really well and feel you have a great analytical presence/delivery, especially when responding to difficult questions. Though I also agree with your candid self assessment on articulating your SQL proficiency. Specifically, after self-rating yourself ~9/10 in SQL, we wanted to perceive more confidence in describing Window Function use cases and de-duping records across very large datasets.   As you can probably imagine, there are many fantastic candidates such as yourself pursuing these limited roles. So if it doesn’t end up working out this time, there will be other opportunities down the road that may.   Rob"
796,Praneeth Korukonda,Robert Becotte,"Hello Rob,  I hope this message finds you well. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to interview with you. Thank you for taking the time to interview me, and I genuinely appreciate the insights you and swathi provided into the team and the role I would be working on.  After reflecting on the interview, I realized that I may not have answered the SQL questions as thoroughly as I would have liked. I take full responsibility for this, and I believe my proficiency in SQL is more robust than my responses reflected. I'm genuinely very interested in the position.  If it's possible, I would greatly appreciate a second chance to showcase my SQL skills and prove that I'm a strong fit for the role. I understand that your time is valuable and you are busy with your work, and I appreciate your consideration.  Thank you for your understanding and for considering my request.  Best regards Praneeth Korukonda"

1403,Praneeth Korukonda,Hridhoy Datta,Oh okay 
1404,Hridhoy Datta,Praneeth Korukonda,It’s more like a screening before you move on to a panel or technical
1405,Hridhoy Datta,Praneeth Korukonda,It’s probably going to be more casual
1406,Praneeth Korukonda,Hridhoy Datta,And my interview is of 30min
1407,Praneeth Korukonda,Hridhoy Datta,"And like what sort of questions do they ask if there is a technical one, like will they ask any leet code problems or will go through the basics "

2402,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Great! Thank you for your inputs.
2403,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Yeah, compared to other universities, I would recommend NU"
2404,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"Would you recommend NU, given the current situation?"
2405,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,I see
2406,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"I am not sure, but I heard it is not good as of now"
2407,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Any idea about the ones graduating this year- what is the job situation for them?
2408,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,Used*
2409,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Due to the current market, the companies are not hiring like they use to"
2410,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Is it mostly because of the current job market?
2411,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,I see
2412,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,Nope not till now
2413,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Any co-op offers?
2414,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,Done with my 2nd sem
2415,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Are you in your second semester?
2416,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,I did not get any on campus till now
2417,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Yeah, it is"
2418,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"It has high competition, try applying to the positions which are open for you from the workday portal"
2419,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Really? Is part time difficult?
2420,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Its possible if you get an on campus job, but its very hard to get one here"
2421,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"Also, what I was thinking was that I could get a loan disbursed only for my tuition, right from my first semester and take care of my living expenses all by myself. Is that realistic (possible)?"
2422,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,Its*
2423,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"It good, mainly comprised of ds topics"
2424,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"How's DAE, as a program? course-wise, I mean"
2425,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,But if we try hard we can get one
2426,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Not everyone, depends on the individual"
2427,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Does everyone get a co-op there? Esp in DAE?
2428,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"by $10k, I guess"
2429,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"I feel the roi is good, due to the location and co-ops which you do"
2430,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"So, It is lesser than NU"
2431,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,So it is better to go with NU
2432,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,Yeah but i guess the fee for WSU is almost same right 
2433,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"How would you overall rate this program? Is the ROI worth it, considering the fact that I am taking a loan of around $50k (as of now, it is overwhelming for me to think about it, you know)?"
2434,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,No NU doesn’t give any of those
2435,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,But this year it it hard due to the recession 
2436,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,Does NU give out scholarships/fellowships in the second semester ? I haven't received any financial aid as of now.
2437,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"TA/RA have heavy competition, co-ops and opportunities wise it is good"
2438,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,"How would you rate it in terms of education, career opportunities, co-ops, TA/RA/GA?"
2439,Praneeth Korukonda,Aiman Muzaffar,"Oh okay, I don’t have much idea about GWU , but NU is better compared to WSU"
2440,Aiman Muzaffar,Praneeth Korukonda,George Washington Uni

2540,Praneeth Korukonda,Phani Chavali,"Hello Phani Chavali,  I am excited to apply for the Data Analyst position at Bayer. As a current Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering student at Northeastern University with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Manipal Academy of Higher Education, I have developed a strong foundation in statistics, programming, and data analysis.  In my previous role as a Data Analyst at Tredence Analytics, I reduced the deduplication process runtime by 33% by developing an incremental process in SQL. I collaborated with a team to design solutions that met client's business requirements and presented visualization reports using Python, SQL, and Excel. Additionally, I gained experience in Tableau by maintaining and working on various interactive dashboards.  Through my academic projects, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and database management. For instance, in my Depressed Patient classification project, I implemented XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and achieved 76% accuracy with Random Forest as the best-performing model using binary classification data. Moreover, in my Chicago Crime Analysis project, I used data storytelling techniques to uncover trends and hotspots of crime in Chicago using Python and Tableau.  I am highly proficient in programming languages and tools such as Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ScikitLearn), R, C++, and database management tools such as SQL and NoSQL. My key competencies include critical thinking, quick learning, team collaboration, and problem-solving.  I am confident that my experience and skillset align with the requirements for the Data Analyst co-op position at Bayer.i am attaching my resume for your reference, if you find my profile suitable for this position, can you please consider and reach out to me if you need additional information from me.  Sincerely, Praneeth Korukonda"

2924,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,"yeah, utd has a lot of electives"
2925,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,I think UTD has a lot of electives whereas for UMD the course is kind of already structured and there are not many options for electives
2926,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,UTD has a lot of students so its harder to get a job on campus i guess
2927,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,"Yes, its comparatively easier to get an on-campus job at UMD"
2928,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,does umd have any campus opportunities which help in reducing the tution?
2929,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,"yeah, actually all the 3 University are having somewhat similar curriculum "
2930,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,So does UMD's curriculum align with what you are looking for?
2931,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,my priority is course curriculum and location
2932,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,What is your first priority - course curriculum/university ranking/lower tuition/location?
2933,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,thank you very much for your response
2934,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,I would definitely recommend UMD
2935,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,"Yep, everyone will give you a review based on their personal experience, so it will get confusing for sure"
2936,Praneeth Korukonda,Apurva Dixit,"yeah and also the fee is the same for almost all the universities so I am confused, and i am getting mixed responses from different people, so just wanted your view as you are studying there, what would you recommend?"
2937,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,"I also had an admit from UTD, but I chose UMD because it has a very high ranking and course is well structured"
2938,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,So there are a lot of job opportunities in the US irrespective of the university
2939,Apurva Dixit,Praneeth Korukonda,Hi Praneeth

3031,Medha Taldar,Praneeth Korukonda,"Now to answer your second question, there are currently no machine learning courses as part of the curriculum but I know personally that a professor is working on adding that. I'm not sure when that might be, I can definitely find out and get back to you"
3032,Medha Taldar,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hi Praneeth,  I am sorry for not responding earlier, it has been an extremely busy week so it skipped my mind.  To answer your earlier question, I am personally not well aware of UTD's program to give much insight but in terms of job placement, I will say that UF has been pretty good. Due to COVID things in terms of recruiting were slow as it was virtual but they are getting their footing. However, unlike India, the US puts a lot of emphasis on networking and a lot of that does depend on you individually and what you do outside of the classroom essentially to build your network and speak to recruiters. But companies like EY, Deloitte and KPMG and Disney regularly recruit at UF. UF also is a big brand name, especially in recent years as it has shot up in rankings. However, the program is rigorous. Not much in the content but the pace in which it moves. So at times it is a little overwhelming to accommodate everything. However, the professors are extremely welcoming so if you ever just want to sit with them and do leetcode that is always an option."
3033,Praneeth Korukonda,Medha Taldar,"hello Medha,  hope you are doing great,  I recently got admitted into ufl msisom program, if you don't mind, can you please tell me whether there are courses related to ML and DL in the course curriculum, I went through the course structure but did not find any courses related to those but I am not sure whether they are included in the core subjects  thanks in advance"

3035,Praneeth Korukonda,Souparno Chakraborty,"oh okay, thank you for the response"
3036,Souparno Chakraborty,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hi .. when I was there , there was a statistical analysis vourse which provided basic ML concepts .. I already did ML work before so , I just built on that...  From what i know there has been a curriculum change last semester where in more ML stuff was added "
3037,Praneeth Korukonda,Souparno Chakraborty,"hello souparno,  hope you are doing great,  I recently got admitted into ufl msisom program, if you don't mind, can you please tell me whether there are courses related to ML and DL in the course curriculum, I went through the course structure but did not find any courses related to those but I am not sure whether they are included in the core subjects  thanks in advance"

3083,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,You're welcome
3084,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,thanks for the information Gautam
3085,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hey Praneeth,   I'm doing good. I hope you're well.  Congrats on your admit! Being a grad student at UF, I've got no regrets joining the university. Gainesville is a super friendly place, a lot of attractions in and around, and the weather is nice too. Job and internship opportunities in my opinion depends on your personal skill set and how pro active you can be. UF has a decently good career fair as well so you're open to multiple opportunities as a grad student. Nowadays, most student apply for internships/full time jobs online on LinkedIn, indeed, monster etc. so UF isn't all that bad when looking at opportunities. There are loads of part time opportunities available at the university so that's something you shouldn't be too worried about."
3086,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,"hi Gautam,  hope you are doing great,  I got admitted into ufl msisom program, I am in the process of selecting the universities, can you please tell the pros and cons of studying at UFL, and also can you please tell me about its location, like the job opportunities, internship opportunities and part-time jobs at UFL  thanks in advance"
3087,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,thanks Gautam
3088,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,You’re welcome!  
3089,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,"$1,251*"
3090,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,It’s 1251 per credit. And you’ll have to do either 30 or 32 credits in total to graduate. 
3091,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,if you don't mind can you tell me the total fee incurred for the complete masters program
3092,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,"oh ok, thanks for the information gautam"
3093,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,"But, we do get emails regarding funding opportunities. Most of them are valid for US citizens though."
3094,Gautam Jaladi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hey Praneeth,   So generally the university does not give financial aid that easily to graduate students. You’ll have to check with the graduate advisor of the department you’re applying to for the best information. I wouldn’t wanna give you any wrong any wrong information "
3095,Praneeth Korukonda,Gautam Jaladi,"hi Gautam, thanks for connecting, I am applying to university of Florida this fall, so wanted to ask you about the funding opportunities available at UF for incoming students  thank you"
3096,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,oh okay thanks
3097,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,I don’t know what you mean by this question. If you are asking if UFL can create a higher impact then it depends on the application pool and where students are applying from. It’s a very relative situation. 
3098,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,"HI Titash, I have a small doubt, can University of Florida make my resume better than other candidates?? "
3099,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,thank you for the information
3100,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,But there are some universities which can make your resume seem better than other candidates for sure. 
3101,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,"University mostly does not matter when you apply for jobs. Your resume and your profile matters. However, a good GPA is an indicAtion of a good student for entry level roles. "
3102,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,in terms*
3103,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,like interns of giving interview opportunities
3104,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,"thanks for your suggestion, I just have this question do big companies give preference to higher rankings universities??"
3105,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,Graduation *
3106,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,Okay thank you. First job is understanding the major. You do have an overlap of courses between the two majors but they aren’t entirely similar.  Both have good jobs in Tech industry too despite not having much coding at all.  Read this blog:  https://csuglobal.edu/blog/what-are-management-information-systems-and-business-analytics   Next is schools. I personally know about UTD being a decent school. I am unsure about UFL. So make an informed decision comparing the coursework and answering what jobs you want to apply for after graifairon. 
3107,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,forgot*
3108,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,sorry I for to mention that msba - masters in business analytics ms isom - masters in information systems and operations management
3109,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,yeah sure
3110,Titash Mandal,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hey Praneeth,  Can you elaborate the course names for me MSBA and MSISOM. "
3111,Praneeth Korukonda,Titash Mandal,"Hi Titash,  Greetings for the day!  I attended the webinar you organised yesterday and  I have a question , can you please give me a suggestion regarding the same,  I am planning to pursue masters this comming fall and got admits in UTD (msba), UFL( msisom) program, but I am confused in choosing one of them and my main priority after masters is to secure a job in a good company   thank you"
3112,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,track as data science*
3113,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,"I have one more question, if you don't mind can you answer this, is robotics process automation a good subject, as there are nothing much related to it on the website. and also in your opinion which course in elective is best to take in my first sem, I want to choose my elective as data science"
3114,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Thank you
3115,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,All the best!
3116,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,Good to know!
3117,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,"I was getting mixed responses earlier, now I got clarity regarding the number of  subjects, thank you"
3118,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,Everthing here is about time management.You can do a lot of things if you want to both on campus and in academics
3119,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,you can take 3 core courses and 1 elective
3120,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,it is not very difficult and the fees will also be less this way
3121,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,I would personally suggest doing 4 courses
3122,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,"I have an other question, is it better to take 3 or 4 courses in my first semester, as I want to do part time and be involved in student clubs, can you please give some guidance regarding this  thanks in advance"
3123,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,"okay, thanks for sharing"
3124,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,Praneeth Korukonda,Advances stats for BA - Toptal Business Analytics with R - Jason Parker Database foundations for BA - R Narayan
3125,Praneeth Korukonda,Shreya Reddy Pagidi,"Hi Shreya, hope you are doing great,  I am planning to pursue masters in business analytics from UTD, I am in the process of selecting professors for classes, can you please suggest me some professors for database foundation course, programming with R and advance statistics   thanks in advance"

3157,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"oh okay, thanks"
3158,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Generally they do these in batches. Like Jan 15 deadline batch, some Feb deadline batch etc"
3159,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"hi tejaswi, you said there are 3 rounds for few students right, does this mean that they had the interviews again after 1st round?"
3160,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,Thank you
3161,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,Hope you get the admit soon
3162,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,You're welcome
3163,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"oh okay, thanks for the information"
3164,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"For me it was just one round, for few students there were 3 rounds, so i think it totally depends on your profile and performance in ur interview."
3165,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"i have a question, will there be another round if i did not get selected in the first round of interviews or direct rejection?"
3166,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,oh okay thanks for the information
3167,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"I gave my interview around Feb 15 and got the results around march, generally they send u the decision within a month max."
3168,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,I meant the timeline for you when you gave the interview
3169,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"hi tejaswi, hope you're doing well  i am done with both my interviews on Feb 8th, i Just wanted to know like when can I get a decision regarding my application, if you have any idea about this,can you please let me know  thanks in advance"
3170,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,oh ok thanks for the information
3171,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Your Cgpa is good but the avg work experience here at OSU MS BAnDS is around 2 years and the avg GRE score last year was around 318, and here there are ppl with gre score more than 330 too, but the admissions are given by looking at students profile holistically, so if something stands out in your profile you still have a decent chance."
3172,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,if you don't mind can you tell me my chances of admission at OSU and assistantships gpa 8.22 undergrad- mech(2021) project - 2 in mech and 1 project in analytics 1 - internship in analytics work ex 5 months( as an analyst) gre -313  thanks in advance ielts- 7.5
3173,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"oh ok, thank you "
3174,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Dr C gives them out, you don't have to apply"
3175,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,They give them during the admission and also at the start of the semester based on your incoming credentials. I got it before coming to US but a lot of ppl got it after coming here.
3176,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"thanks for the information Tejaswi, I have a doubt, do we need to apply assistantships seperately or does the universities give them at the time of admission?"
3177,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,While nothing is promised but every year there are quite a few assistantship opportunities and almost 50% of the cohort gets assistantships.
3178,Tejaswi Maruthi,Praneeth Korukonda,"Hi Praneeth, the course is a bit hectic but the internship opportunities are great, i got my internship here in the first month itself. And ROI is great, i had assistantship which is why i chose OSU, most of my tuition fee is waived and the cost of living is decent. Overall its a good course you will get internships and jobs but to land in FAANG companies you need to work on your own."
3179,Praneeth Korukonda,Tejaswi Maruthi,"hi Tejaswi, I am applying to OSU this fall, can you please tell me about the university and the opportunities near the universities for internships and jobs   Thanks you"

If you know anyone from the admission team, please feel free to email them. I will let you know if I get to know anything. You may try to email the professor who conducted the interview and explain the situation if you don't hear from anyone."
3198,Praneeth Korukonda,Jeffin Jacob,"hello sir, hope you're doing well, sir, if you remember, you had an interview with me on Feb 4th, i completed my professor interview on 8th February, but did not receive any update regarding my application, i really want to get into OSU but don't know if was selected or not, and also deposit deadline for other universities are on Feb 16th, so i am feeling very tensed.  so sir, if possible can I know the feedback of the interview,like did you feel that i am suited to OSU or not.
